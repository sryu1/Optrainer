# Optrainer

I have noticed that there weren't many tutorials/templates using optuna, so I created this :)

Nothing really works yet

## Setup

```console
pip install optuna gymnasium stable-baselines3==2.0.0a1
```

## Quick Run

Run main.py to choose which algorithm to use and start discovering the optimal hyperparameter!
